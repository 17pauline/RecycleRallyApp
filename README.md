# RecycleRally 

RecycleRally is an Android app meant to encourage people to recycle and have fun doing it.

Therefore, it has three main goals:
* serving as a **recycling journal** for users
* creating a **virtual community** in which users compete with each others to earn points for each item they recycle
* integrating a **deep learning algorithm** to classify the recyclable items into 6 classes - paper, plastic, glass, metal, cardboard and trash
