# RecycleRally 

RecycleRally is an Android app meant to encourage people to recycle and have fun doing it.

Therefore, it has three main goals:
* serving as a **recycling journal** for users
* creating a **virtual community** in which users engage in competitive activities with the common goal of making our planet greener
* showcasing the integration of a **deep learning algorithm** to classify the recyclable items into 6 classes - paper, plastic, glass, metal, cardboard and trash

The development of the PyTorch algorithm implemented in this app can be followed [here](https://github.com/tznpau/waste-classifier).
